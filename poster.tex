  \block{Editing Conflicts}{%

    \begin{tikzfigure}
      \includegraphics[height=12.5cm]{conflict-silhouette.eps}
    \end{tikzfigure}

    A new editor makes a contribution. It is immediately reverted and
    their work is apparently "lost".

    \begin{quote}
    A careful editor wants a space to refine and get feedback on a
    draft edit over a period of time, without worrying about unrelated
    edits causing conflicts.
    \end{quote}

    A user encounters an edit conflict and gives up.

    \begin{quote}
    A computer crash just before publishing a long edit causes all
    work to be lost.
    \end{quote}

    A minority editor wants a safe space to work without
    immediate harassment.

  \block{Offline Contributions}{%

    \begin{tikzfigure}
      \includegraphics[height=20cm]{Bucolico-full.jpg}
    \end{tikzfigure}

    A Peruvian school-child finds no information in Wikipedia about
    their hometown, but can't contribute an article because they are
    using the wiki offline.

  }
  \column{0.33}
  \block{Tor!}{%

    \begin{tikzfigure}
      \includegraphics[height=20cm]{censored-nospeaking.eps}
    \end{tikzfigure}

    A user in a repressive regime can only safely access Wikipedia by
    using Tor, but in a catch-22 they then lose the ability to make
    contributions.

\begin{columns}
  \column{0.33}
  \block{Fork-Merge}{%

    With a fork-and-merge model new users whose content isn't
    immediately merged find it preserved on their fork for revision
    and re-submission, reducing their sense of rejection and
    loss. Offline users who are forced to work on an out-of-date copy
    and those using the draft namespace can use the same improved
    tools when their contributions are brought to merge. During online
    edits we can auto-save to a fork, and if conflicts are found we
    can safely defer resolving them without losing work.

  }
  \column{0.34}
  \block{Collaborative Edit Queues}{%
With volunteer-run queues for merging contributions, we can incorporate contributions from offline editors or Tor users, or rescue conflicted edit attempts.

}
  \column{0.33}
  \block{Volunteer Communities}{%
  We then can collect edits from more diverse and less-connected users
and provide a friendlier first-edit experience to retain
newcomers. Volunteer merge queues provide another means for those
well-connected to aid those with difficulties in the spirit of
ubuntu. By increasing participation we can bridge the knowledge gap.
